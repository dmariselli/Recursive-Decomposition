# Recursive-Decomposition
Algorithm to recursively decompose a graph into a Directed Acyclic Graph. For COSC-490 Dependence &amp; Testability

## Current Status
- Implemented Tarjan's Algorithm for discovering Strongly Connected Components.
- Recursively decomposes sets of strongly connected components and combines relevant edges.

### To Do
- Modify Tobi Oni-Orisan's algorithm to use newly formed "super"-edges.
